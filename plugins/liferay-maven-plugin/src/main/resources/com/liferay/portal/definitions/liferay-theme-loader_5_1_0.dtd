<!--
The theme-loader element is the root of the deployment descriptor for a Liferay
theme loader. A theme loader is required to allow the LAR export and import
mechanism to hot deploy themes at runtime even if the underlying application
server does not support hot deploy.
-->
<!ELEMENT theme-loader (themes-path?, file-storage?)>

<!--
The themes-path element tells the theme loader where to store the themes inside
the exploded WAR. This is also the path used to prefix the root-path of all
themes loaded by this theme loader. The default is "/themes".
-->
<!ELEMENT themes-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The file-storage element tells the theme loader where to store the files. If
this element is not set, then it will store the files inside the exploded WAR's
"themes" directory or inside the directory set by the element themes-path. If
this element is set, it expects a full path to an external directory.
