<!--
The service-builder element is the root of the deployment descriptor for
a Service Builder descriptor that is used to generate services available to
portlets. The Service Builder saves the developer time by generating Spring
utilities, SOAP utilities, and Hibernate persistence classes to ease the
development of services.
-->
<!ELEMENT service-builder (namespace, entity+, exceptions?)>

<!--
The package-path value specifies the package of the generated code.
-->
<!ATTLIST service-builder
	package-path CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--
The namespace element must be a unique namespace for this component. Table names
will be prepended with this namespace. Generated JSON JavaScript will be scoped
to this namespace as well (i.e., Liferay.Service.Test.* if the namespace is
Test).
-->
<!ELEMENT namespace (#PCDATA)>

<!--
An entity usually represents a business facade and a table in the database. If
an entity does not have any columns, then it only represents a business facade.
The Service Builder will always generate an empty business facade POJO if it
does not exist. Upon subsequent generations, the Service Builder will check to
see if the business facade already exists. If it exists and has additional
methods, then the Service Builder will also update the SOAP wrappers.

If an entity does have columns, then the value object, the POJO class that
is mapped to the database, and other persistence utilities are also generated
based on the order and finder elements.
-->
<!ELEMENT entity (column*, order?, finder*, reference*, tx-required*)>

<!--
The name value specifies the name of the entity.

The table value specifies the name of the table that this entity maps to in the
database. If this value is not set, then the name of the table is the same as
the name of the entity name.

If the uuid value is true, then the service will generate a UUID column for the
service. This column will automatically be populated with a UUID. Developers
will also be able to find and remove based on that UUID. The default value is
false.

If the local-service value is true, then the service will generate the local
interfaces for the service. The default value is false.

If the remote-service value is true, then the service will generate remote
interfaces for the service. The default value is true.

The persistence-class value specifies the name of your custom persistence class.
This class must implement the generated persistence interface or extend the
generated persistence class. This allows you to override default behavior
without modifying the generated persistence class.

You can generate classes to use a custom data source and session factory.
Point "spring.configs" in portal.properties to load your custom Spring XML with
the definitions of your custom data source and session factory. Then set the
data-source and session-factory values to your custom values.

The data-source value specifies the data source target that is set to the
persistence class. The default value is the Liferay data source. This is used in
conjunction with session-factory. See data-source-spring-professional.xml (or
data-source-spring-enterprise.xml).

The session-factory value specifies the session factory that is set to the
persistence class. The default value is the Liferay session factory. This is
used in conjunction with data-source. See data-source-spring-professional.xml
(or data-source-spring-enterprise.xml).

The tx-manager value specifies the transaction manager that Spring uses. The
default value is the Spring Hibernate transaction manager that wraps the Liferay
data source and session factory. See data-source-spring-professional.xml (or
data-source-spring-enterprise.xml).

<!--
The column element represents a column in the database.
-->
<!ELEMENT column (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The name value specifies the getter and setter name in the entity.

The type value specifies whether the column is a String, Boolean, or int, etc.

For example:

<column name="companyId" db-name="companyId" type="String" />

The above column specifies that there will be a getter called
pojo.getCompanyId() that will return a String.

Set db-name to map the field to a physical database column that is different
from the column name.

If the primary value is set to true, then this column is part of the primary key
of the entity. If multiple columns have the primary value set to true, then a
compound key will be created.

See com.liferay.portal.service.persistence.LayoutPK for an example of a compound
primary key.

If the entity and mapping-key attributes are specified and mapping-table is not,
then the Service Builder will assume you are specifying a one to many
relationship.

For example:

<column
	name="shoppingItemPrices"
	type="Collection"
	entity="ShoppingItemPrice"
	mapping-key="itemId"
/>

The above column specifies that there will be a getter called
pojo.getShoppingItemPrices() that will return a collection. It will map to a
column called itemId in the table that maps to the entity ShoppingItemPrice.

If the entity and mapping-table attributes are specified and mapping-key is not,
then the Service Builder will assume you are specifying a many to many
relationship.

For example:

<column
	name="roles"
	type="Collection"
	entity="Role"
	mapping-table="Groups_Roles"
/>

The above column specifies that there will be a getter called
pojo.getRoles() that will return a collection. It will use a mapping table
called Groups_Roles to give a many to many relationship between groups and
roles.

The id-type and id-param values are used in order to create an auto-generated,
auto-incrementing primary key when inserting records into a table. This can be
implemented in 4 different ways, depending on the type of database being used.
In all cases, the primary key of the model object should be assigned a value of
null, and Hibernate will know to replace the null value with an auto-generated,
auto-incremented value. If no id-type value is used, it is assumed that the
primary key will be assigned and not auto-generated.

The first implementation uses a class to generate a primary key.

For example:

<column
	name="id"
	type="Integer"
	primary="true"
	id-type="class"
	id-param="com.liferay.counter.service.persistence.IDGenerator"
/>

In this implementation, the class specified in the id-param value will be called
to retrieve a unique identifier (in the example above, an Integer) that will be
used as the primary key for the new record. This implementation works for all
supported databases.

The second implementation generates identifiers that are unique only when no
other process is inserting data into the same table. This implementation should
NOT be used in a clustered environment, but it does work for all supported
databases.

For example:

<column
	name="id"
	type="Integer"
	primary="true"
	id-type="increment"
/>

The third implementation uses an identity column to generate a primary key.

For example:

<column
	name="id"
	type="Integer"
	primary="true"
	id-type="identity"
/>

In this implementation, the create table SQL generated for this entity will
create an identity column that natively auto-generates a primary key whenever
an insert occurs. This implementation is only supported by DB2, MySQL, and
MS SQL Server.

The fourth implementation uses a sequence to generate a primary key.

For example:

<column
	name="id"
	type="Integer"
	primary="true"
	id-type="sequence"
	id-param="id_sequence"
/>

In this implementation, a create sequence SQL statement is created based on
the id-param value (stored in /sql/sequences.sql). This sequence is then
accessed to generate a unique identifier whenever an insert occurs. This
implementation is only supported by DB2, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SAP DB.

The convert-null value specifies whether or not the column value is
automatically converted to a non null value if it is null. This only applies if
the type value is String. This is particularly useful if your entity is
referencing a read only table or a database view so that Hibernate does not try
to issue unnecessary updates. The default value is true.

<!--
The order element specifies a default ordering and sorting of the entities when
they are retrieved from the database.
-->
<!ELEMENT order (order-column+)>

<!--
Set the by attribute to "asc" or "desc" to order by ascending or descending.
-->
<!ATTLIST order
	by CDATA #IMPLIED
>

<!--
The order-column element allows you to order the entities by specific columns.
-->
<!ELEMENT order-column (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The attributes of the order-column element allows you to fine tune the ordering
of the entity.

For example:

<order by="asc">
	<order-column name="parentLayoutId" />
	<order-column name="priority" />
</order>

The above settings will order by parentLayoutId and then by priority in an
ascending manner.

For example:

<order by="asc">
	<order-column name="name" case-sensitive="false" />
</order>

The above settings will order by name and will not be case sensitive.

For example:

<order>
	<order-column name="articleId" order-by="asc" />
	<order-column name="version" order-by="desc" />
</order>

The above settings will order by articleId in an ascending manner and then by
version in a descending manner.

<!--
The finder element represents a generated finder method.
-->
<!ELEMENT finder (finder-column+)>

<!--
-->
<!ATTLIST finder
	name CDATA #REQUIRED
	return-type CDATA #REQUIRED
	where CDATA #IMPLIED
	db-index CDATA #IMPLIED
>

<!--
The finder-column element specifies the columns to find by.
-->
<!ELEMENT finder-column (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The name value specifies the name of the finder method.

For example:

<finder name="CompanyId" return-type="Collection">
	<finder-column name="companyId" />
</finder>

The above settings will create a finder with the name findByCompanyId that will
return a Collection and require a given companyId. It will also generate
several more findByCompanyId methods that take in pagination fields (int begin,
int end) and more sorting options. The easiest way to understand this is to
look at a generated PersistenceImpl class. The Service Builder will also
generate removeByCompanyId and countByCompanyId.

See com.liferay.portal.service.persistence.LayoutPersistenceImpl for a good
example.

The attribute comparator takes in the values =, !=, <, <=, >, >=, or LIKE and is
used to compare this column.

The attribute case-sensitive is a boolean value and is only used if the column
is a String value.

<!--
The reference element allows you to inject services from another service.xml
within the same class loader. For example, if you inject the Resource entity,
then you'll be able to reference the Resource services from your service
implementation via the methods getResourceLocalService and getResourceService.
You'll also be able to reference the Resource services via the variables
resourceLocalService and resourceService.

The tx-required element has a text value that will be used to match method names
that require transactions. By default, the methods: add*, check*, clear*,
delete*, set*, and update* require propagation of transactions. All other
methods support transactions but are assumed to be read only. If you want
additional methods to fall under transactions, add the method name to this
element.
