<!--
The look-and-feel element is the root of the deployment descriptor for
a Liferay look and feel archive. The look and feel archive will hereafter
be referred to as a LAF archive.
-->
<!ELEMENT look-and-feel (compatibility, theme*)>

<!--
The compatibility element specifies a list of Liferay Portal versions that will
properly deploy the themes in this LAF archive.
-->
<!ELEMENT compatibility (version+)>

<!--
The version element specifies a specific Liferay Portal version number. For
example, if its value is "3.5.0", that means the themes in this LAF archive will
deploy correctly in Liferay Portal 3.5.0. The portal will not deploy themes from
a LAF archive unless the version numbers match.
-->
<!ELEMENT version (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The theme element contains the declarative data of a theme.
-->
<!ELEMENT theme (root-path, templates-path, images-path, template-extension,
settings?, color-scheme+)>

<!--
The id attribute specifies the unique key for a theme. The name attribute
specifies the friendly name of a theme that is displayed to the user.
-->
<!ATTLIST theme
	id CDATA #REQUIRED
	name CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--
The root-path value sets the location of the root path for the theme. For
example, the root path for the Classic theme is "/html/themes/classic". This
means you can find the files for the Classic theme in
/docroot/html/themes/classic.
-->
<!ELEMENT root-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The templates-path value sets the location of the templates path for the theme.
For example, the templates path for the Classic theme is
"/html/themes/classic/templates". This means you can find the JSP templates for
the Classic theme in /docroot/html/themes/classic/templates.
-->
<!ELEMENT templates-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The images-path value sets the location of the images path for the theme. For
example, the images path for the Classic theme is "/html/themes/classic/images".
This means you can find the images for the Classic theme in
/docroot/html/themes/classic/images.
-->
<!ELEMENT images-path (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The templates-extension value sets the file extension of the files located in
the templates directory. If you specify the value "jsp", then the portal will
look for files such as portal_nav.jsp in the templates directory. If you specify
the value "vm", then the portal will look for files such as portal_nav.vm in the
templates directory. Specifying "vm" means you can use Velocity to create your
theme. New extensions will be supported in the future to allow for even more
flexibility in the creation of themes.
-->
<!ELEMENT template-extension (#PCDATA)>

<!--
The settings element contain a list of settings or properties that are available
to the theme object at runtime. They are described with a key value pair.

For example, you can access it with the command: theme.getSetting("hello").
-->
<!ELEMENT settings (setting*)>

A theme can have many color schemes. It works very similar to Windows. The
Windows XP theme has one set of color schemes, and the Windows Classic theme
has another set of color schemes. Each color scheme contains a list of colors
that helps decorate the theme.
